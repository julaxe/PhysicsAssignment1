Simulating this Problem in c++ and SDL.

1. Over a completely flat surface a thermal detonator (Star Wars) is thrown by a wookiee (a
member of the rebel alliance) towards a group of imperial stormtroopers. The thermal
detonator always leaves the wookieeâ€™s hand with a speed of 95m/s and the thermal detonator
has a mass of 2.2Kg.
a) Suppose that the Stormtroopers are 485m away. What is the correct angle for the
wookiee to throw the thermal detonator so that it reaches the Stormtroopers.
b) What is the maximum distance the thermal detonator could travel?
